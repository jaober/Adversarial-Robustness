# Adversarial Robustness

*While this project has been concluded, uploading the code files is currently a work in progress.*

Research project on transferring adversarial robustness of deep learning models across domains.

Repository contains sample code for 
- preprocessing image data & defining data loaders 
- training a convolutional neural network on image data
- evaluating the adversarial robustness of a trained model
- retraining the last layers of a pretrained deep neural network
- hyperparameter tuning for retraining fully connected laywrs of a pretrained neural network
- median smoothing
- center smoothing
- obtaining theoretical lower bounds on the adversarial robustness of a retrained deep learning model
